 I am currently studying for a bachelor's degree at Payame Noor University
 <br>
 That's why I chose this university 
 <br>
 Because of my interest in this field, I want to become a professional programmer so that I can be useful for myself and the community.
 <br>
 The reason I chose this university was that it was the only university near where I lived that had this field
 <br>
 The positive point of this university is the reasonable cost and a good and experienced department
 <br>
 I am very familiar with this field due to the fact that this field is well-known and up-to-date
 <br>
 Newer experiences I want to gain at this university are mastering programming languages ​​and gaining more experience.
 <br>
 My favorite field of specialization is programming and security
 <br>
 I am also inclined to continue my studies in the next stages
 <br>
 I intend to be able to offer useful and practical programs with the knowledge I gained after continuing my education
 <br>
 Apart from studying and working, my hobbies and interests are music, sports, computer, virtual world, film, photography.
 <br>
 One of my special abilities that I think the university needs to be aware of is teaching computer courses
